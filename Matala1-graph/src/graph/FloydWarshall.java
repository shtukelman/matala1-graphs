/*
 * The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest path between
 * all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph with either positive or negative
 * edge weights but without negative edge cycles.
 * 
 * The running time of the algorithm is O(n^3), being n the number of nodes in
 * the graph.
 *
 * This implementation is self contained and has no external dependencies. It 
 * does not try to be a model of good Java OOP, but a simple self contained 
 * implementation of the algorithm.
