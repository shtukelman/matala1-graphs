# matala1-graphs
This project is about graphs, using dijkstra algorithm to solve the following questions:

1)Calculate distance between two vertex in graph (shortest path).

2)Return all the vertex in shortest path.

3)Calculate distance between two vertex in graph (shortest path), with BlackList (List of Vertex are not allowed to pass through).

4)Return Radius, Diameter, Triangle inequality.

5)Algorithm runtime.
